Of course, your filenames will be different than mine. They are alphabetized, so they will likely appear in a different order, too. The subfolder inside of the images folder is optional. You might find it useful to further categorize your pictures, but it is not required. The image files inside of the images and subfolder folders are examples. Yours, of course, will be named differently.
